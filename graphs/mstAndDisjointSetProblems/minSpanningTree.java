// what is the minimum spanning tree of a graph?
// The minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph is a subset of the edges that connects all vertices together without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
// The MST is a tree that spans all the vertices in the graph, and it has the minimum sum of edge weights among all possible spanning trees.
// The MST is useful in various applications, such as network design, clustering, and optimization problems.
// The MST conditions are:
// 1. The MST must include all vertices of the graph.
// 2. The MST must not contain any cycles.
// 3. The total weight of the edges in the MST must be minimized.
