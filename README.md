# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my personal solutions to a variety of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. It’s a collection of problems solved in multiple languages, focused on learning, improving coding skills, and preparing for technical interviews. 

Although I've started pushing solutions later in my learning journey, so you may not find many patterns such as arrays, linked lists, binary search in arrays and BST in graphs, recursion, bit manipulation yet, I plan to eventually add these as I revise all these patterns to prepare for my interviews. :)

## What you’ll find here
- Classic algorithms and patterns (DP, Graphs, recursion, greedy, etc.)
- Solutions in Go, Java, Python, C++, and more
- Clean, readable code and meaningful comments

## Why I’m doing this
I use this repo to:
- Track my DSA progress
- Refine my coding & problem-solving skills
- Prep for coding interviews

Feel free to browse, learn, or suggest improvements!

Happy Coding!
